    <h2>Who are we?</h2>
    <p><em>God's Toolbox</em> is a nonprofit online retailer designed to help supply tools
       to missionaries around the world. For every tool bought from our online store, we will
       donate that same tool to a missionary of your choice.</p>
    <h2>Where are we from?</h2>
    <p>We are based our of Granite Falls, Washington, with our main office located in the house
       of CEO and Head Chairman, <a href="taylor.php">Taylor Beeston</a>. Don't let the local
       nature of our headquarters fool you, we will happily deliver to anywhere in the world,
       including Antarctica!</p>
    <h2>Why tools?</h2>
    <p>We believe that the most important thing you can give to someone is the tools to make
       themselves succeed. It is not up to us to decide what will get done with the tools we 
       provide, but it brings us great joy to see what God has allowed people to do with the
       tools we have given them.</p>
