# God's Toolbox

## [God's Toolbox](https://godstoolbox.herokuapp.com) is a fake e-commerce site that I made as a school project.

### I wrote 100% of the code with PHP, without using any frameworks.

#### Features include:
- SQL Abstraction
- User authentication
- Content Management
- Cart/Checkout System
- Strict XHTML Compliance
- Sanitizations/general security best practices
- Sweet pictures of tools I took myself!

#### Why put this on Github?

Well, I was pretty proud of how this project turned out, and I figured that it
might be good to show off as a demonstration of some PHP work that I've done.
I tried to employ many neat tricks in here to make PHP a little bit nicer to
work in, and if I was ever tasked with making an e-commerce website entirely with
PHP, I'd probably start by cloning this project!

#### Contributing

While this isn't exactly an Open-Source project by nature, I did decide to add
an MIT License, and if someone felt inclined to work on it and submit a PR, I'd
probably happily merge it! That said, I don't plan on working on this really at
all in the future, so don't be offended if nothing about it ever changes!
